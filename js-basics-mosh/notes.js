// Dynamic Typing

/* javascript is a dynamic language 
Static(Statically-Typed)- When we declare a variable the type of the variable is set
and it cannot be changed.
Dynamic(Dynamically-typed)- The type of a variable can change at runtime */
//Use typeof operator to check variable value in console
// Number Type - Javascript only has one type of number. It does not have floating point numbers and integers.
// Null- The variable type for a null value is an object

// OBJECTS - REFERENCE TYPES
// Objects, arrays, functions

let name = 'Colin'
let age = 30;
//rather than writing two variable we can declare an object to make code cleaner
let person = {
    name: 'Colin',
    age: 30
}; //Defined as an 'Object Literal'
// Object is created with a Key-Value Pair

// DOT NOTATION - can be used to redefine a property within an object
person.name = 'John'; //redefines the 'person' property within the object
//dot notation can be used to read the value of a property
//console.log(person.name); will display the name property

//BRACKET NOTATION - a different approace to access/change an objects property
person['name'] = 'Mary';// use square brackets and pass in a string

let selection = 'name'

/* Bracket Notation is useful to use when the value of the variable is not determined
until runtime. For Ex. The user may be asked to input value at runtime and that will
define the variable.*/

operator will behave differently.
console.log(++x); if you put the ++ before x it will be incremented
first and the the output will be printed. Output: 11
in contrast, if you put the operator after x, the value will be
printed and then incremented afterward. Output: 10 */

//Decrement (--) behaves the same way as (++)

// Assignment
let x = 10; 
x++; //this code
x = x + 1;// is equivalent to this code.

// Comparison

//Equality
console.log(x === 1); //equal to 
console.log(x !== 1); // not equal to

// Strict Equality(same Type + same Value)
console.log(1 === 1);
/* Strict Equality operator ensures that both of these values
have the same type and value 
The values above are both numbers and are both 1 so the output 
would be true*/

//This comparison would evaluate to false because they are different types.

// Loose Equality (converts types to match and evaluates based on values)
console.log(1 == 1); //evaluates to true
console.log('1' == 1); //evaluates to true
// Converts to true because the value on the right will be converted
// to match the value on the left

// Ternary (Conditional Operator)
// If a customer has more than 100 points
// They are a 'gold' customer, otherwise
// they are a 'silver' customer.
let points = 110;
let type = points > 100 ? 'gold' : 'silver';
//result of this expression is true or fals, boolean
// if condition evalutes to true we use the first value
// if false we use the second value.

// Returns True if both operands are TRUE
// If either operand is false then Returns FALSE

let highIncome = true;
